**********************
The CS:APP Data Lab
Directions to Students
**********************

Your goal is to modify your copy of bits.c so that it passes all the
tests in the driver program (driver.pl) with full credit.

***************************
1. Testing your bits.c file
***************************

We've provided you with a number of tools to test the puzzle solutions
in your bits.c file. See the lab writeup for details on how to use
them.

BDD checker: The BDD checker is a program that performs an exhaustive
check of the correctness of your puzzle solutions. Use the BDD checker to
do the authoritative correctness test. If the BDD checker finds an
error, it will provide you with the argument value(s) that gave the
wrong answer.

dlc compiler: Each puzzle in bits.c has a coding guideline that
specifies a limited set of legal operators that you are allowed to
use, and a maximum number of operators.  The dlc (Data Lab
Compiler) tool is a C front-end that checks each puzzle solution for
adherence to the coding guidelines.

driver.pl: This is a driver program that invokes the BDD checker and
dlc to check your solutions in bits.c for correctness and adherence to
the programming guidelines. It also displays your total correctness
score, including points for correctness (awarded to correct functions
that use only legal operators) and performance (awarded to correct
functions that use less than the maximum number of operators).	This is
the identical program that Autolab uses when it autogrades your
submissions.

******************
2. Helper programs
******************

We have included the ishow and fshow programs to help you decipher
integer and double-precision floating point representations respectively. Each takes multiple
decimal or hex numbers as arguments. To build them type:

    unix> make

Example usages:

    unix> ./ishow 0x27
    Hex = 0x00000027,	Signed = 39,	Unsigned = 39

    unix> ./ishow 0x27 27
    Hex = 0x00000027,	Signed = 39,	Unsigned = 39
    Hex = 0x0000001b,	Signed = 27,	Unsigned = 27

    unix> ./fshow 0x15213243
    Double Precision Floating point value 1.751448342e-315
    Bit Representation 0x15213243, sign = 0, exponent = 0x00, fraction = 0x15213243
    Denormalized.  +0.0000000787 X 2^(-1022)

    linux> ./fshow 0x15213243 15213243
    Double Precision Floating point value 1.751448342e-315
    Bit Representation 0x15213243, sign = 0, exponent = 0x00, fraction = 0x15213243
    Denormalized.  +0.0000000787 X 2^(-1022)

    Double Precision Floating point value 7.516340728e-317
    Bit Representation 0x00e822bb, sign = 0, exponent = 0x00, fraction = 0xe822bb
    Denormalized.  +0.0000000034 X 2^(-1022)
